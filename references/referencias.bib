title = {Assessment of precipitation and near-surface temperature simulation by CMIP6 models in South America},
journal = {Environmental Research: Climate},
abstract = {This study evaluated the performance of 50 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in simulating the statistical features of precipitation and air temperature in five subdomains of South America during the historical period (1995–2014). Monthly precipitation and temperature simulations were validated with data from the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation, the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, and the ERA5 reanalysis. The models’ performance was evaluated using a ranking analysis with statistical metrics such as mean, standard deviation, Pearson’s spatial correlation, annual cycle amplitude, and linear trend. The analyses considered the representation of precipitation and air temperature separately for each subdomain, the representation for all five regions together, and the joint representation of precipitation and air temperature for all five subdomains. In the Brazilian Amazon, the best-performing models were EC-Earth3-Veg, INM-CM4-8, and INMCM5-0 (precipitation), and IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM2-0, and IITM-ESM (temperature). In the La Plata Basin, KACE-1-0-G, ACCESS-CM2, and IPSL-CM6A-LR (precipitation), and GFDL-ESM4, TaiESM1, and EC-Earth3-Veg (temperature) yielded the best simulations. In Northeast Brazil, SAM0-UNICON, CESM2, and MCM-UA-1-0 (precipitation), BCC-CSM2-MR, KACE-1-0-G, and CESM2 (temperature) showed the best results. In Argentine Patagonia, the GCMs ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5 and EC-Earth3-Veg-LR (precipitation), and CAMS-CSM1-0, CMCC-CM2-HR4, and GFDL-ESM4 (temperature) outperformed. Finally, for Southeast Brazil, the models ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, and EC-Earth3-Veg-LR (precipitation), and CAMS-CSM1-0, CMCC-CM2-HR4, and GFDL-ESM4 (temperature) yielded the best simulations. The joint evaluation of the regions and variables indicated that the best models are CESM2, TaiESM1, CMCC-CM2-HR4, FIO-ESM-2-0, and MRI-ESM2-0.}

  abstract  = {This work introduces the experimental design and main results of a coordinated modeling study within the framework of a Flagship Pilot Study endorsed by the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The objective is to apply high-resolution climate downscaling for hydrological and agricultural modeling in Southeastern South America (SESA). To this end, targeted simulations using convection-permitting regional climate models (CPRCM at 4 km resolution) and deep learning-based empirical statistical downscaling were performed covering 3 consecutive years from June 2018 to May 2021. These simulations were used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model to simulate the streamflow of the Uruguay river and the Agricultural Crop Simulator to reproduce crop yields over Southern Brazil. An ensemble of six CPRCMs and a variety of statistical downscaling models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) contributed to this project. Overall, CPRCMs and CNNs show skill in reproducing daily precipitation over SESA, with different abilities in simulating the different aspects of precipitation extremes (dry and wet), although within the range of observational uncertainty. The intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability of extreme events and their frequency over the different sub-regions of SESA are very well captured by the simulations with most correlations between 0.63 and 0.88. This aspect also translates into the Uruguay River streamflow simulations (with time correlations above 0.42) whose response appears to be highly sensitive to precipitation intensity and location. The largest impacts on soybean yield simulation are related to low precipitation intensity and spatial variability, reaching to mean spatial biases up to -20\%.}

  abstract  = {South America is a large continent with a wide diversity of weather and climate features, including tropical, subtropical and extratropical regimes interacting within a complex landscape. Simulations by global climate models, as well as their downscaling through regional circulation models or statistical methods, are important tools, particularly when assessing the impacts of climate change in the continent. This work evaluates 57 models of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) in their simulation of various spatial patterns and circulation features over South America. Our evaluation aims to provide useful input for the selection of climate models to force regional simulations in South America. Therefore, we focus on spatial fields that are relevant for regional simulations, such as horizontal winds, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature (SST), and moisture and energy fluxes across the domain boundaries. Additionally, we evaluated different circulation features influencing the regional climate of South America that have not been widely evaluated in these models. Several indices are studied to assess the main low-level and upper-level continental-scale circulation patterns, the regional Walker and Hadley cells, the subtropical highs and the boundary SST patterns. Our results show that no single model performs best across all evaluated features, highlighting the importance of in-depth model evaluation for the region concerning the features of interest.}

  abstract  = {Climate models are indispensable tools for decision-making, yet their efficacy in characterizing climatic conditions in regions of complex topography, such as Central-Western Argentina (CWA), remains challenging. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate mean and extreme values of temperature and precipitation simulations from a set of CMIP6 climate models in CWA. The mean values were compared against CRU TS 4.05 for the period 1950–2014; and the extreme values against ERA5 for the temperature and ERA5, CPC, and CHIRPS for the precipitation during 1981–2010. To evaluate the mean values, we considered several statistical metrics that accounted for the representation of the annual cycle, the long-term trends, and the spatial patterns, followed by a selection of the climate models that best represent the region. Subsequently, we analyzed 20 climate extreme indices using Taylor Diagrams and box-and-whiskers plots. The CMIP6 models tended to exhibit a wet bias over CWA, with temperature simulations warmer (colder) than observations over the Andes (Lowlands). Moreover, most models adequately captured the increase in temperature, as well as the increase in precipitation in the lowlands and its decrease in the Andes. From the set of 24 precipitation and 12 temperature simulations, we evaluated the performance for the representation of climate extremes, finding that most models had difficulties with the quantification of indices based on percentiles. This climate information can be valuable to obtain more accurate climate projections for CWA and to aid decision-making in a region with significant wine production and high reliance on water resources.}
