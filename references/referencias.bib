%CNN para statistical downscaling (spatio-temporal) of precipitation. Creates RCM-emulator based on CNN. Emulator is obtained with data from RMC and GCM , validated with RCM data and aplicated to GCM future data.  Model validation bsed in several metrics: correlation, sd ratio, concentration contribution.

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
